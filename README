## Basic Usage
## Examples ##

Some Examples (based on examples provided by Sallar)

```php
// Current date time
$date = jdf::jdate('H:i:s Y/m/d');

// current date time in unix time format
$date = jdf::jmktime();

// or create your jalali unix tiem format 
$date = jdf::jmktime($h,$m,$s,$jm,$jd,$jy);
```


## Notes ##

The class relies on ``strtotime()`` to make sense of your strings, and ``strftime()`` to make the format changes.  Just always check the ``time()`` output to see if you get false timestamps... which means the class couldn't understand what you were telling it.
